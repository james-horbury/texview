# OpenGL Depth Test

This is an introductory exercise in the coordinate systems section of learnopengl.com created by [Joey DeVries](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries). 
The [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) library will be built locally to ensure compatability and stability across environments.

# How to Run

To compile the program simply execute the following from within the src directory:

`g++ main.cpp glad.c -ldl -lglfw`
